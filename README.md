# Turing 2.3.3 REST API for Digits Prediction Model

## Introduction
This is an exercise to recreate digits predicting model from sklearn and put it in REST API created with Flask, to request the prediction from model.

## Results

Model accuracy and f-1 score is high and equal to `0.9689`

After checking response times we got that 20 individual requests vary, but are around 2 times faster than one batch request.
